# Hypixel-TS-Library
Repository for Hypixel API TypeScript types and utilities

## Installation

```bash
npm install hypixel-ts-library
```

## Basic Usage

Proper documentation will eventually be completed. For now, this is the sample code and includes a small sub-set:

```ts
import type { BazaarDataItem, BazaarDataBase } from "hypixel-ts-library";
```

## Suggestions and Issues

If you have suggestions, put them into issues for now. 

## Origin of the Project

Hypixel API documentation is not that good, and that is not a secret. 

This repository and package will be dedicated to the open source community as both: a pet project, and also a central location for everyone to complete it.

You will find types mostly, but perhaps even a few development functions in the future.

Feel free to contribute to the repository as we grow together!

## Notes

- Please note, yes I am aware of typing of "any" -- this is because of a lack of information. Please open a PR that fills the gaps with appropriate typing or that corrects the pre-existing.
